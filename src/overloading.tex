\rSec0[over]{Overloading}

Modify paragraph 1 to allow overloading based on constraints.

\begin{quote}
\pnum
When two or more different declarations are specified for a single name 
in the same scope, that name is said to be overloaded. By extension, two 
declarations in the same scope that declare the same name but with
different types \added{or different associated constraints (\ref{temp.constr.decl})}
are called \defn{overloaded declarations}. Only function and function 
template declarations can be overloaded; variable and type declarations 
cannot be overloaded.
\end{quote}

%% OVerloadable declarations

\rSec1[over.load]{Overloadable declarations}

Update paragraph 3 to mention a function's overloaded constraints. 
Note that the itemized list in the original text is omitted in this
document.

\begin{quote}
\setcounter{Paras}{2}
\pnum
\enternote
As specified in \ref{dcl.fct}, function declarations that have equivalent 
parameter declarations \added{and associated constraints, if any 
(\ref{temp.constr.decl})}, declare the same function and therefore cannot be 
overloaded: ...

%% Declaration matching

\rSec1[over.dcl]{Declaration matching}

Modify paragraph 1 to extend the notion of declaration matching to
also include a function's associated constraints. Note that the
example in the original text is omitted in this document.

\begin{quote}
Two function declarations of the same name refer to the same function if 
they are in the same scope and have equivalent parameter declarations 
(\ref{over.load}) \added{and equivalent associated constraints, if any 
(\ref{temp.constr.decl})}.

\setcounter{subsection}{1}
\rSec2[over.match.viable]{Viable functions}

Update paragraph 1 to require the checking of a candidate's associated
constraints when determining if that candidate is viable.

\begin{quote}
\pnum
From the set of candidate functions constructed for a given context 
(\cxxref{over.match.funcs}), a set of viable functions is chosen, from which 
the best function will be selected by comparing argument conversion 
sequences and associated constraints for the best fit 
(\ref{over.match.best}).
%
The selection of viable functions considers \added{associated constraints, 
if any (\ref{temp.constr.decl}), and} relationships between arguments and function 
parameters other than the ranking of conversion sequences.
\end{quote}

Insert a new paragraph after paragraph 2; this introduces new a criterion for 
determining if a candidate is viable. Also, update the beginning of the 
subsequent paragraph to account for the insertion.

\begin{quote}
\setcounter{Paras}{2}
\pnum
\added{Second, for a function to be viable, if it has associated constraints, 
those constraints shall be satisfied (\ref{temp.constr.decl}).}

%% Best viable function

\rSec2[over.match.best]{Best viable function}

Modify paragraph 1 by adding a rule to the the criteria that determines when 
one function is better than another. 

\begin{quote}
Given these definitions, a viable function
\tcode{F1}
is defined
to be a
\term{better}
function than another viable function
\tcode{F2}
if
for all arguments
\textit{i},
ICS\textit{i}(\tcode{F1}) is not a worse conversion
sequence than ICS\textit{i}(\tcode{F2}), and then
\begin{itemize}
\item
for some argument
\textit{j},
ICS\textit{j}(\tcode{F1}) is a better conversion
sequence than ICS\textit{j}(\tcode{F2}), or, if not that,

\item
the context is an initialization by user-defined conversion
(see~\cxxref{dcl.init},
\cxxref{over.match.conv}, and~\cxxref{over.match.ref})
and the standard conversion sequence from the return type of
\tcode{F1}
to the destination type (i.e., the type of the entity being initialized)
is a better conversion sequence than the standard conversion sequence
from the return type of
\tcode{F2}
to the destination type
\enterexample
\begin{codeblock}
struct A {
  A();
  operator int();
  operator double();
} a;
int i = a;          // \tcode{a.operator int()} followed by no conversion is better than
                    // \tcode{a.operator double()} followed by a conversion to \tcode{int}
float x = a;        // ambiguous: both possibilities require conversions,
                    // and neither is better than the other
\end{codeblock}
\exitexample
or, if not that,

\item the context is an initialization by conversion function for direct
reference binding (\cxxref{over.match.ref}) of a reference to function type, the
return type of \tcode{F1} is the same kind of reference (i.e. lvalue or rvalue)
as the reference being initialized, and the return type of \tcode{F2} is not

Fn&& rf = a;        // calls \#2

or, if not that,

\item
\tcode{F1}
is not a function template specialization and

is a

\item

and the function template
for \tcode{F1} is more specialized than the template for \tcode{F2}
according to the partial ordering rules described in~\ref{temp.func.order},
or, if not that,

\item
\added{\tcode{F1} and \tcode{F2} are non-template functions with the same 
parameter-type-lists, and  \tcode{F1} is more constrained than \tcode{F2} 
according to the partial ordering of constraints described in 
\ref{temp.constr.order}, or if not that,}

\item
\tcode{F1} is generated from a
\grammarterm{deduction-guide}~(\cxxref{over.match.class.deduct})
and \tcode{F2} is not, or, if not that,

\item
\tcode{F1} is the copy deduction candidate~(\cxxref{over.match.class.deduct})
and \tcode{F2} is not, or, if not that,
