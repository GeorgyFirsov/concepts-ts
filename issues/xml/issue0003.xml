<p>
The following requirement seems overly restrictive, as it can be fairly
easily (but tediously) be worked around: "A <i>requires-expression</i> shall
appear only within a concept definition (7.1.7), or within the
<i>requires-clause</i> of a template declaration (Clause 14) or function declaration
(8.3.5)."

(The tedious workaround for each concept C is to define an overload set
consisting of two function templates, one unconstrained and returning false,
the other constrained by C and returning true.)
</p>

<p>
Proposed change: Eliminate the requirement, thereby permitting
other uses for this new kind of expression of type <code>bool</code>. (For example,
requires­-expressions might replace many or all of the Boolean type traits.)
Additionally, in any context where a bool value is permitted, allow a
concept’s name plus suitable arguments to denote the truth value of the claim
that "this combination of arguments satisfy this concept." (This syntax is
currently valid in only certain contexts such as requires­expressions.)

Suggest opening an EWG issue.
