<title>Allow concepts to be evaluated in any context</title>

<p>
Currently, concepts are only guaranteed to be evaluable within the context
of a requires-expression. Among other things, this guarantees that the following
will not work:

<code>
static_assert(C&lt;X&gt;(), ""); // for some concrete X
</code>
</p>

<p>
Evaluating a concept in any context effectively requires that it be evaluated
as if in a SFINAE context. The original design of concepts did not require
this because it was not clear how easy this would be for all implementers.
Based on EWG discussions in Kona, this appears to no longer be the case.

This issue is submitted as a result of an EWG straw poll taken during discussion
