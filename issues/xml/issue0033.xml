<p>
The term "template specialization" is most commonly used as a term meaning
"specialization of a template", i.e., "class template specialization, function
template specialization, variable template specialization or alias template
specialization" (e.g., in [temp.names]). Using "specialization"
instead of "template specialization" here would cause no normative change, but
make the logic easier to follow. Namely, the instantiation behaviour of
associated constraints on functions is already covered by 14.6 [temp.decls], and
constraints can otherwise only be associated with templates.
